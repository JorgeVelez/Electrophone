# Pickup

Pickup is a Eurorack module containing a full-sized single coil guitar pickup.  

This module is a sister to the Mikrophonie Contact Mic Module. The Mikrophonie picks up physical vibrations, while Pickup can hear electromagnetic vibrations. Guitar pickups are designed to convert vibrating metal (strings) into audio, but single coil pickups are also notoriously susceptible to interference of all kinds; hum from transformers, fluorescent lights or even radio signals.
